   abstract = {Nowadays the steel market is becoming ever more competitive for European steelworks, especially as far as flat steel products are concerned. As such competition determines the price products, profit can be increased only by lowering production and commercial costs. Production yield can be significantly increased through an appropriate scheduling of the semi-manufactured products among the available sub-processes, to ensure that customers’ orders are timely completed, resources are optimally exploited, and delays are minimized. Therefore, an ever-increasing attention is paid toward production optimization through efficient scheduling strategies in the scientific and industrial communities. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to improve the flexibility of production scheduling in steelworks producing flat steel products. Such approach combines three methods holding different scopes and modelling different aspects: an auction-based multi-agent system is applied to face production uncertainties, multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming is used for global optimal scheduling of resources under steady conditions, while a continuous flow model copes with long-term production scheduling. According to the obtained simulation results, the integration and combination of these three approaches allow scheduling production in a flexible way by providing the capability to adapt to different production conditions.},

   abstract = {With the advent of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the possibilities of controlling manufacturing processes through the information provided by a network of sensors connected to work centers have expanded. Real-time monitoring of each parameter makes it possible to determine whether the values yielded by the corresponding sensor are in their normal operating range. In the interplay of the multitude of parameters, deterministic analysis quickly becomes intractable and one enters the realm of “uncertain knowledge”. Bayesian decision networks are a recognized tool to control the effects of conditional probabilities in such systems. However, determining whether a manufacturing process is out of range requires significant computation time for a decision network, thus delaying the triggering of a malfunction alarm. From its origins, JIDOKA was conceived as a means to provide mechanisms to facilitate real-time identification of malfunctions in any step of the process, so that the production line could be stopped, the cause of the disruption identified for resolution, and ultimately the number of defective parts minimized. Our hypothesis is that we can model the internal sensor network of a computer numerical control (CNC) machine with quantum simulations that show better performance than classical models based on decision networks. We show a successful test of our hypothesis by implementing a quantum digital twin that allows for the integration of quantum computing and Industry 4.0. This quantum digital twin simulates the intricate sensor network within a machine and permits, due to its high computational performance, to apply JIDOKA in real time within manufacturing processes.},

   abstract = {The undershoot of the reorder point in the periodic review, order-up-to-level (R, s, S) inventory system is known to follow a complex probability distribution which depends on the value of S-s (Δ) and the distribution of the demand during the review interval (R). We focus on the continuous demand case with full backlogging and variable lead-time. For this case, a generic formulation of the undershoot probability density function (p.d.f.) is developed. The order quantity probability distribution in (R, s, S) systems is the same as the undershoot probability distribution with a shift of Δ in the random variable. Therefore, the latter opens the possibility of calculating valuable managerial information such as the expected average order quantity, its standard deviation, and the probability that the order quantity is lower than or exceeds a predetermined value. Based on the proposed formulation, we derive an analytical expression of the undershoot p.d.f. (and hence the order quantity p.d.f.) for the case of gamma distributed demand, as well as a tractable approximation for the normal distributed demand. Both expressions are shown to be dependent upon two nondimensional parameters, Δ/μR and the coefficient of variation, with the mean demand during the review interval (μR) acting as a scale parameter. We thus define a nondimensional undershoot p.d.f. (NUPDF). The relevance of full nondimensionalization stems from the fact that gamma and normal NUPDF analyses can be scaled to any case of gamma and normal distributed demands. Although we focus on the inventory management viewpoint, the results for the gamma distributed case can be directly adapted for use in any renewal process.},
