title: Improving scheduling models for different processes in the aeronautical supply chain

description: |

This research project  aims to identify areas for improvement in the optimization of scheduling different processes in the aeronautical supply chain. More specifically, it concerns  productive phase and mainly covers  both Aggregated Production Planning (APP) and Final Assembly Lines (FAL) problems.

On one side, APP problem seeks to schedule annual production at a plant taking into account not only economic but also environmental factors. On the other side, FAL problem tries to speed up the ordering of the multiple tasks of this line as well as achieve the most efficient allocation of resources.

The purpose is to provide flexility and agility in solving these problems by using MILP models (implemented in AIMMS language) and continously improving them.

On one side, APP problem seeks to schedule annual production at a plant taking into account not only economic but also environmental factors. On the other side, FAL problem tries to speed up the ordering of the multiple tasks of this line as well as achieve the most efficient allocation of resources using clustering of tasks.
