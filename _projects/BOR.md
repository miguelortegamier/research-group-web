  We work on applying Behavioural Economics concepts and theories to decision problems faced traditionally by the Operations Research discipline.  We pursue this aim by means of modelling and experimentation.

  For example, our contribution to CIO 2021 studied the effect of behavioural biases (like the "trembling hand" phenomena) in the time a person spends queuing in a system with queues.



  <h3> Highlighted end-of-degree projects (TFG/TFM in Spanish): </h3>
<ul>

  <li>Jaime Portolés San Segundo worked on understanding the influence of moral framing on decisions, through experimentation and statistical hypothesis testing.</li> 

  <li>Ana Corral Cajigas studied in her bachelor's thesis the influence of different kinds of supermarket configurations and decision heuristics on the time people spend queuing.</li>

  <li>In the project with Antonio Pérez López del Hierro (2019), we studied the influence of decision times on human cooperative behaviour, using advanced statistical techniques. Experimental data from ∼1000 people who participated in a Public Goods Game experiment from Pereda et al. (2019) was used. We found no significative relationship between decision times and duration of decisions, probably due to the way the data was collected.</li>
