  We work on applying Behavioural Economics concepts and theories to decision problems faced traditionally by the Operations Research discipline.  We pursue this aim by means of modelling and experimentation.


  Highlighted end-of-degree projects (TFG/TFM in Spanish):

  Ana Corral Cajigas is currently studying the influence of decision choices and the "trembling hand" phenomena in the time a person spent queuing at a supermarket. Different kinds of supermaket configurations and decision heuristics are explored.

  Jaime Portoles San Segundo works on undestanding the influence of moral framing on decisions, by means of experimentation and statistical hypothesis testing. 

  In the project with Antonio Pérez López del Hierro (2019), we studied the influence of decision times on human cooperative behaviour, using advanced statistical techniques. Experimental data from ∼1000 people who participated in a Public Goods Game experiment from Pereda et al. (2019) was used. We found no significative relationship between decision times and duration of decisions, probably due to the way the data was collected.
